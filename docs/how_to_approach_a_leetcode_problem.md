# How to Approach a LeetCode Problem

1. **Understand the Problem**
   - Read the problem statement carefully.
   - Identify the input, output, and constraints.
   - Clarify any ambiguities.

2. **Plan Your Approach**
   - Think of possible solutions.
   - Analyze the time and space complexity of each approach.
   - Choose the most efficient solution that fits within the constraints.

3. **Write Pseudocode**
   - Break down the solution into smaller steps.
   - Write pseudocode to outline your approach.

4. **Implement the Solution**
   - Translate the pseudocode into actual code.
   - Use meaningful variable names and add comments for clarity.

5. **Test Your Code**
   - Test with sample inputs provided in the problem.
   - Create additional test cases to cover edge cases and constraints.

6. **Optimize if Necessary**
   - Look for ways to improve the time or space complexity.
   - Refactor your code for better readability and maintainability.
